## Sensing The Environment

The Goal(s):

Design and build sensor kits to gather environmental data; use techniques of data science (deep learning) to analyse and interpret the data that we collect; and discover and tell the hidden stories about these species and spaces through virtual/augmented/mixed reality.

## The First Project: Acoustic monitoring

Design and build a prototype for a kit to detect, track, and identify migrating birds and bats through sound. We currently have very little data for the region and while there are wonderful operational devices in existence, new technology and creative minds like you can create a mobile, (wireless), self-sustaining version we can use on rooftops, windows, all over Portland and the Pacific Northwest. Ideally, the new device would be battery-powered (with solar recharging, even better), and the system could record every sound onto a thumb drive or send it wirelessly to the cloud. Come play, experiment in collaborative teams, and create an amazing device that allows us to discover the birds and bats that inhabit and move through our region!

## The Second Project:  Creating sensor kits for volunteer citizen scientists

Design and build a mobile sensor kit that gathers environmental data (about air, water, soil, light, canopy, ...) and connects to a corresponding app on your phone. The goal is to find correlations between the various fauna and flora and their environment. We focus on the Sandy River and its delta to help determine which organisms are thriving or suffering in which environments so that they can direct volunteer efforts in planting trees and creating waterways that best support these organisms (plants, animals, reptiles, bugs, fish, etc.).

## Coming soon (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018) 

We hope to deploy all these kits in the late summer and fall (for this season) and for all of 2018. In the fall, we plan to host two series of workshops. The first will focus on using data science and machine learning/AI to analyse the data we collect. The second will be on designing for VR/AR/MR to find ways of using emerging technologies to visualise our insights, and the ecological and cultural history of this ecosystem. Look for this wonderful series of stories and narratives on Earth Day 2018.

This will be a joint endeavor between students, educators, enthusiasts, industry professionals.
