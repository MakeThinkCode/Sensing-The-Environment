# Sensing-The-Environment
The Sensing the Environment project is a series of collaborative projects between Make+Think+Code@PNCA, Intel, and the Sandy River Basin Watershed Council to use art and technology to better understand our ecosystems, and the habitats and behaviours of birds and other life that shares our environment.
